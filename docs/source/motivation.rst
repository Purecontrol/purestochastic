Motivations and Goals
######################

The goal of the library is to create a high-level interface for stochastic modelling in Tensorflow.
At present, there is no global implementation of stochastic models at the same place. Therefore, 
the aim of the library is to gather the different stochastic model into the same place so that
it's easy to compare them and to use them. 

The library is in construction and there is only a few models. However, feel free to contact me 
if you want to add a model or if you find an issue.
